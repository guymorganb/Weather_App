# Weather_App

## Description

- This document was made in order to serve as a learning opportunity for me to understand how to retrieve data from a 3rd party API, sort and use that data to be used to display information in a useful way.

- This page was created to serve as a generic and simple app, used to view the weather forecast. As well as the current weather conditions

- This project solves the problem of needing to demonstrate the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically update and manage the page dynamically use 3rd party API data and presenting that information usefully.

- I was able to expand my knowleged of JavaScript after having been coding for only 5 months, Ive been learning how it can be applied to the working needs of a user. I was also able to understand the level of detail that goes into even something this simple.
